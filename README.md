Glaucoma detection using CNN and study on class imbalance problem using data augmentation and GAN

Glaucoma refers to eye disorders that result in harm to the optic nerve, leading to either vision loss or blindness. Without treatment glaucoma tends to worsen gradually over time, making early detection and treatment crucial. Deep learning based on CNN was used for the detection of glaucoma using fundus images. But deep learning requires datasets which contains huge amount of labelled high-quality images to predict with high accuracy. It is because of the need to extract important and complex patterns or features from the images for tuning its parameters and to reduce the modelâ€™s loss. But often the availability of such datasets is scarce and sometimes the datasets available will be highly imbalanced. In this paper, we have addressed the issue of an imbalanced dataset by using 2 sets of data augmentation techniques and GAN to make the dataset balanced and thereby increase the size of the dataset. The first set includes operations such as changing rotation, height, flipping etc. The second set includes operations such as changing hue, saturation, and contrast. The second set of augmentation provided the best result with an accuracy of 0.821 when compared with the rest of the approaches.
